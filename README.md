## Introduction

The goal of this repository is to provide practical examples and implementations that demonstrate the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) when integrated with various tools and frameworks. Each project is designed to address specific use cases, offering insights into how LLMs can be leveraged in real-world applications.

## Projects

1. **Chatbot**: An interactive chatbot built using LangChain and Hugging Face models, capable of engaging in dynamic conversations.

2. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System**: A system that enhances the response generation of LLMs by retrieving relevant information from a knowledge base.

3. **Agents**: Autonomous agents designed to perform specific tasks, utilizing LangChain's agent framework for decision-making processes.

*Note: Detailed documentation for each project is available within their respective directories.*
