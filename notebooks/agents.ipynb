      "Okay, let's see. The user asked for the weather in San Francisco. I used the Tavily search tool to get the latest info. The first result from WeatherAPI shows the current temperature is 11.7춿C (53.1춿F) with partly cloudy conditions. The second source mentions sunny weather with day temperatures at 66춿 and night at 54춿. Wait, there's a discrepancy here. The WeatherAPI data is for April 30, 2025, at 7:25 AM, showing cooler temps, while the second link says day is 66춿. Maybe the second source is a forecast or a different time. I should check the dates and times. The WeatherAPI entry has localtime as 2025-04-30 07:25, so that's the current reading. The other URL's title mentions April 30, 2025, but the content says day 66춿, which might be a typo or different measurement. Since the user is asking for the current weather, I should rely on the WeatherAPI data. Also, the first source has more detailed metrics like wind, humidity, etc., which adds credibility. The second source seems less detailed and might be a static page. So, the accurate answer is the 11.7춿C with partly cloudy from WeatherAPI. I'll present that and mention the slight difference in the second source, but clarify that the first is the current data.\n",
